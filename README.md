\# 🌐 Enterprise Network Design Project



\## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves the design and simulation of a comprehensive \*\*Enterprise Network\*\* using \*\*Cisco Packet Tracer\*\*. It bridges the gap between theoretical networking concepts and practical application, featuring a secure, scalable, and efficient infrastructure.



\## 🛠️ Key Technologies \& Features

\* \*\*Network Simulation:\*\* Cisco Packet Tracer.

\* \*\*IP Addressing:\*\* Implemented \*\*VLSM\*\* (Variable Length Subnet Masking) for efficient address allocation.

\* \*\*Switching:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* \*\*VLANs:\*\* Segmentation of departments to enhance security and traffic management.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Inter-VLAN Routing:\*\* Enabled communication between different VLANs.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*STP:\*\* Spanning Tree Protocol configuration to prevent switching loops.

\* \*\*Routing:\*\* Configured Dynamic Routing (OSPF) for redundancy and optimal path selection.

\* \*\*Network Services:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* \*\*DHCP:\*\* Automated IP assignment for end devices.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*NAT/PAT:\*\* Network Address Translation for internet access simulation.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Security:\*\* Basic ACLs (Access Control Lists) and port security.



\## 📂 Repository Contents

\* `project1.pkt`: The source simulation file (requires Cisco Packet Tracer).

\* `Doc\_IP1.pdf`: Detailed documentation including the topology map, addressing table, and configuration steps.



\## 🚀 How to Run the Simulation

1\.  Download the `.pkt` file from this repository.

2\.  Open it using \*\*Cisco Packet Tracer\*\* (ensure you have a compatible version).

3\.  Allow the network to converge (wait for link lights to turn green).

4\.  Use the \*\*Simulation Mode\*\* to visualize packet flow (ICMP, ARP, etc.).
